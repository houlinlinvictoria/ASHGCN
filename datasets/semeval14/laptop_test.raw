so in a brief summary i would have to say that i would not recommend dell vostro 1000 to anyone due to it being a down right awful $T$ so in my opinion you should steer clear of them if you want a decent laptop .

$T$ will indirectly deal with your problems by constantly tranferring you from one country to another , and I am not kidding you , I called different hours of the day and you 'll get someone else from another country trying to get you to tell them your life story all over again , since they make it sound like they do n't have your history list of your calls right in front of them .
